# Contribution

Thank you for considering to help!

This project drives through ideas. So if you have any please create an issue explaining what problem you have or what feature you dream of. The better you describe your issue the easier are the further steps (concepts, implementations, tests, ...).

If you found an issue you would like to work on, please leave a mark in that vary issue to let everyone know that you want to do that. Once you have done that feel free to follow the usual github contribution workflow (fork branch, push changes to your fork, open pull request). Feel free to open a pull request even if you are not done yet to get some feedback.
