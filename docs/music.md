## Filter

You might apply filters to your the music videos in your collection. This filters the list so that you can create a playlist out of the filtered videos.

You can apply multiple filters. Those work additive. That means if you have one filter for videos with the tag 'cinematic' and a userrating of 7 and higher and a second filter for all videos that contain the search phrase 'warrior', you exclude all videos that neither contain 'warrior' nor are tagged with 'cinematic' with a userrating of 7 and higher.

Each filter works on its own, so if you define a specific tag and a minimum duration within one filter, those values only apply to that filter.  
If you select multiple tags within the same filter only those videos who contain all tags will be contained through this filter.

You can find the selectable tag 'None' in the drop down. This tag reflects all videos that have no tags attached. Using 'None' with additional tags does not make any sence, so the filter will focus on the 'None' part.
